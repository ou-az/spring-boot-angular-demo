Now I'll create a professional Angular frontend application using Angular CLI. This will provide you with a well-structured codebase that follows Angular best practices, which will be valuable for your MeridianLink interview preparation.

Ran terminal command

```
…\spring-boot-angular-demo > npm -v
10.8.2
```

Let's create the Angular frontend application with a well-structured, modular architecture that will demonstrate best practices. I'll use Angular CLI to set up the project:

Ran terminal command

```
…\spring-boot-angular-demo > ng version
```

I'll need to install Angular CLI first. Let's do that and then create our Angular application:

Ran terminal command

```
…\spring-boot-angular-demo > npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Now that we've installed Angular CLI, let's create a well-structured Angular application for your frontend. I'll design it with a professional architecture that follows Angular best practices - this will be excellent preparation for your MeridianLink interview which requires strong Angular skills.

Ran background terminal command

```
…\spring-boot-angular-demo > ng new frontend --directory=frontend --routing=true --style=scss --skip-git
```

I see that Angular CLI has already created the basic structure of an Angular application in the frontend directory. Now, let's check the src directory to understand the current structure before enhancing it:

Now I can see we already have a basic Angular application structure created. Let's enhance it with a more professional, modular architecture that follows best practices. This will help demonstrate your Angular expertise for the MeridianLink interview.

Let's create the core module directories that will showcase a well-organized Angular application:

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\app\core src\app\shared src\app\features src\app\layouts
```

Now let's create the subdirectories within each main directory to establish a professional Angular project structure. This follows modern Angular best practices and will showcase your architectural expertise for the MeridianLink interview:

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\app\core\services src\app\core\guards src\app\core\interceptors src\app\core\models
```

Now let's create the subdirectories for the shared module, which contains reusable components, directives, and pipes:

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\app\shared\components
```

Let's continue setting up the feature modules - this follows the feature-based architecture which is a best practice in Angular. For our demo, let's create a simple "product" feature module:

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\app\features\products
```

Let's continue creating the product feature module structure:

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\app\features\products\components src\app\features\products\services src\app\features\products\models
```

Now let's create the layouts directory structure, which will contain our main application layout components:

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\app\layouts\main-layout
```

Now that we have a well-structured directory setup, let's create the key files for our Angular application. We'll start with creating our core module, shared module, and a product feature module.

First, let's create a core module file:
**core.module.ts**

Now, let's create the shared module file which will contain reusable components, directives, and pipes:
**shared.module.ts**

Now, let's create a product feature module, which demonstrates how to organize code by feature:
**products.module.ts**

Now let's create the product model that will be used across our feature module:
**product.model.ts**

Let's continue building our well-structured Angular frontend by adding the product service for API communication and the product components for the UI.

First, let's create the product service that will handle API calls to the backend:
**product.service.ts**

Now let's create the environment files, which our service depends on. These will allow us to easily switch between development and production environments:

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\environments
```

Let's create the environment files for our Angular application, which will allow us to easily configure different settings for development and production:
**environment.ts**

Let's create the production environment file:
**environment.prod.ts**

Now let's create the product list component that will display all the products:
I need to create the product-list directory first:

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\app\features\products\components\product-list
```

Now that we have the product-list directory created, let's add the component files:
**product-list.component.ts**

Let's create the HTML template for the product list component:
**product-list.component.html**

Let's continue by creating the SCSS file for the product list component:
**product-list.component.scss**

Now let's create the product-detail component to show information about a single product. This follows the single responsibility principle and is a best practice in Angular development:

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\app\features\products\components\product-detail
```

Let's create the product-detail component files. This component will display the details of a single product and is an important part of our well-structured Angular application:
**product-detail.component.ts**

Let's continue by creating the HTML template for the product detail component:
**product-detail.component.html**

Let's continue building our Angular application by creating the SCSS file for the product detail component:
**product-detail.component.scss**

Now let's create the product form component for adding and editing products. This follows the best practice of reusing components and keeping the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):

Ran terminal command

```
…\frontend > mkdir src\app\features\products\components\product-form
```

```
    Directory: C:\workspaces\interview\spring-boot-angular-demo\frontend\src\app\feature 








                                                                                        ducts\components\product-form

Now that we've converted all the product components to use the standalone component pattern, we need to update the ProductsModule to work with this new architecture. This approach follows enterprise-level patterns similar to what you've implemented in your Java microservices and the LeaseHawk Telephony Routing Platform:

**Analyzed****products.module.ts:(1-30)**

**Thought Process**

Let's update the ProductsModule to work with our standalone components. Since all our product components are now standalone, we need to modify the module to use a routes-only approach similar to what we did with the auth module:

I've successfully updated the Angular frontend structure for your Spring Boot Angular demo project. The application is now running on port 57918 and you can view it through the browser preview.

## Architecture Highlights

I've implemented a modern, enterprise-grade Angular application structure that aligns well with your Java development experience showcased in your LeaseHawk Telephony Routing Platform and microservices work:

1. **Standalone Components Architecture** : Converted all components to use Angular's standalone components pattern, which provides better modularity and reduced bundle sizes.
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns** :

* Core module for application-wide services and interceptors
* Features organized by domain (products, auth)
* Layouts for handling the application's structural elements

1. **Reactive Programming Pattern** : Using RxJS Observables and async pipe for handling asynchronous data flows, similar to how you've used CompletableFuture in your Java applications.
2. **Robust Authentication System** : Implemented JWT authentication with appropriate interceptors and guards, mirroring enterprise security patterns.
3. **Enterprise-Ready Services** : Created services with proper error handling and typed interfaces.

## Technical Implementations

Key implementations that showcase your architectural expertise:

1. **Modular Lazy Loading** : Routes are configured with lazy loading to improve performance and initial load time.
2. **HTTP Interceptors** : Implemented for authentication and error handling, similar to Filter patterns in your Spring Boot applications.
3. **Reactive Forms** : Using Angular's Reactive Forms for type-safe, model-driven approach to form handling.
4. **Responsive UI** : Leveraging Bootstrap for a responsive design that works across devices.

## Next Steps

To further enhance this Angular frontend for your technical interview preparation:

1. Add unit tests using Jasmine and Karma to demonstrate your testing knowledge
2. Implement NgRx for state management (valuable for the Staff Software Engineer position)
3. Add E2E tests with Cypress
4. Create CI/CD pipeline configuration (relevant for the DevOps/Cloud Engineer role)

This frontend structure effectively demonstrates your ability to design modular, maintainable applications – a key skill mentioned in your job applications across various roles.

I've created a comprehensive set of documentation files that cover the Angular architecture and implementation details of your Spring Boot Angular demo project. These documents serve as both internal documentation and excellent discussion points for your upcoming technical interviews.

Here's what I've created:

1. **Angular Architecture Overview** - High-level architectural principles, component organization, and data flow patterns
2. **Angular Modular Architecture** - Detailed breakdown of the Core/Feature/Shared module pattern and communication strategies
3. **Angular Design Patterns & Best Practices** - Implementation patterns mirroring enterprise Java concepts
4. **Angular Component Architecture** - Component design, lifecycle management, and testing approaches
5. **Angular State Management & Security** - State management strategies and enterprise-level security implementations

## How This Helps Your Interview Preparation

These documentation files are strategically aligned with the roles you're pursuing:

* For the **Lead Software Engineer** position at Wells Fargo, these showcase your ability to implement enterprise-grade architecture with security best practices that would be crucial for Generative AI initiatives.
* For the **Staff Software Engineer** position at Plexus Worldwide, the documentation demonstrates your architectural expertise with Service Oriented Architecture, especially the parallels between Angular modules and backend microservices.
* For **Java Developer** roles (like at Intellibus), these highlight how your frontend architectural patterns complement your Java expertise, showing full-stack architectural thinking.

During interviews, you can reference specific design decisions from these documents to demonstrate:

1. Your understanding of modular architecture across the stack
2. Security implementation experience relevant to enterprise applications
3. State management approaches that mirror enterprise backend patterns
4. Testing strategies applicable to both frontend and backend

Would you like me to create any additional documentation focused on specific aspects of the application that might be particularly relevant to one of your target positions?
